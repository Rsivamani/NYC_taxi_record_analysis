# NYC Taxi Record Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes New York City taxi trip data to optimize ride-demand forecasting and improve operational efficiency. It processes over 2 million trip records to provide insights that enhance resource allocation and customer experiences.

## Key Analyses
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed 8% anomalies (e.g., duplicates, missing values) from 2M+ records.
- **Demand Patterns**: Identified peak pickup times and days.
- **Payment Trends**: Examined payment method preferences among riders.
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Evaluated trip distances and durations for operational insights.

## Findings
- **Peak Demand**: 6 PM is the busiest hour (199K trips); Wednesdays are the busiest day (463K trips).
- **Payment Preference**: 82% of riders prefer credit cards over cash.
- **Data Challenges**: Messy data required significant cleaning efforts.

## Technology Used
- **Python**:  
  - `Pandas` for data manipulation  
  - `NumPy` for numerical operations  
- **SQL**: For querying and aggregating data  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis  
- **GitHub**: For version control and hosting

## Recommendations
- **Optimize Driver Allocation**: Increase driver availability at 6 PM and on Wednesdays.
- **Enhance Digital Payments**: Strengthen infrastructure to support cashless transactions.
- **Streamline Data Pipelines**: Use automated tools to clean and process data faster.
